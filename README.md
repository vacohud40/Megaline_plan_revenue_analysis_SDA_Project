# Megaline Plan Revenue Analysis: Determining the More Profitable Prepaid Plan

## Project Purpose

This project aims to conduct a preliminary statistical analysis for Megaline, a telecom operator, to determine which of their two prepaid plans – **Surf or Ultimate** – generates more revenue. The findings from this analysis will directly inform the commercial department's advertising budget allocation strategy, enabling them to focus marketing efforts on the more profitable plan and optimize revenue generation.

## Project Description

Megaline offers two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, and seeks to understand their individual revenue contributions. This analysis is based on a relatively small selection of 500 Megaline clients from 2018. The dataset includes comprehensive information on these clients, such as their demographics, the plan they use, and their monthly usage patterns (number of calls, text messages, and internet data usage).

The core tasks of this project include:

* **Data Integration:** Loading and merging multiple datasets (users, calls, messages, internet, plans) to create a consolidated view of each client's behavior and associated plan.
* **Data Preprocessing and Calculation:** Cleaning data, handling missing values (if any), and calculating monthly usage (calls, messages, internet) and the corresponding monthly revenue for each client based on their plan's pricing structure.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the distribution of usage patterns and revenue across both Surf and Ultimate plans.
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Statistically testing hypotheses to determine if there is a significant difference in the average revenue generated by the Surf and Ultimate plans. This will involve comparing the means of the two groups.
* **Conclusion and Recommendations:** Providing clear conclusions on which plan is more profitable and offering data-driven recommendations for adjusting the advertising budget.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas:** For robust data loading, merging, cleaning, aggregation, and manipulation of large datasets.
* **NumPy:** For efficient numerical operations, especially during revenue calculations.
* **Matplotlib:** For creating static data visualizations to illustrate usage patterns, revenue distributions, and hypothesis test results.
* **Seaborn:** For producing aesthetically pleasing and informative statistical graphics.
* **SciPy.stats:** For statistical hypothesis testing, specifically using `ttest_ind` for comparing independent sample means.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** The primary environment for conducting the analysis, experimentation, and presenting findings.

## Dataset

This project utilizes several interconnected datasets provided by Megaline, detailing customer information, usage, and plan specifics for 2018.

* **File Names:**
    * `megaline_users.csv`: Contains user demographics and plan information.
    * `megaline_calls.csv`: Detailed call records.
    * `megaline_messages.csv`: Detailed text message records.
    * `megaline_internet.csv`: Detailed internet session records.
    * `megaline_plans.csv`: Information about the Surf and Ultimate plans (e.g., monthly fee, included minutes/messages/data, overage charges).
* **Original Location (on training platform):** `/datasets/megaline_users.csv`, `/datasets/megaline_calls.csv`, etc.

**Important Note on Data Availability:** Due to the nature of the training environment, these specific `.csv` files are **not included** in this GitHub repository. The `/datasets/` paths are specific to that environment.
